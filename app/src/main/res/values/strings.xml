        \n• the grid size (in meters).

        Welcome to the ExpoLIS mobile app.
        This is the main screen where you can see real time pollution data collected by the sensors
        in the Carris buses.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_online_data_time_bus">
        In the top right area you can see the time when the last pollution data was recorded.
        We can also see the bus number whose pollution data is being shown.

        Tap the button on the bottom right to select which bus to display real time pollution data.

    <string name="tutorial_online_data_pms">
        The plot on the right shows the quantity of particulate matter with sizes 1, 2.5 and 10
        microns.

    <string name="tutorial_online_data_gases">
        The plot on the left shows the quantity of nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide.

        Tapping the leftmost button on the bottom goes to the screen where you can edit the properties of the map plot.

        Tapping the second button from the left on the bottom goes to the screen where you can edit the properties of the chart plot.

        Tapping the middle button on the bottom goes to the planner screen.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_map_plot_edit">
        In this screen you can select which sensor data to visualise in a map.  You can select how to aggregate the data, the time period, and if you want to focus in a particular bus line.

    <string name="tutorial_map_plot_view">
        This screen shows a map of sensor data.  In the bottom there is a short description of what you selected to plot.

        In this screen you can plan a route using different means of transportation and if you want to avoid polluted areas or not.

    <string name="tutorial_edit_plot_raw_data_map">
        The first plot (starting from top) gives access to the raw data map.
        In this plot you can select which pollution data to analyse, how the sensor data is
        aggregated, date interval, and a resolution.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_view_plot_raw_data_map">
        The pollution is shown as a grid on a map.
        The size of each grid cell is given by the resolution (units are meters).
        If more than one sensor reading exists for any given grid cell, then one of the aggregation
        function is used (average, maximum or minimum).
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_edit_plot_location_data_chart">
        The second plot gives access to the location chart.
        In this plot you can select a location on the map: drag the red circle in the map.
        You can also enlarge or decrease the circle: zoom out or zoom in the map.
        Any sensor reading within the circle will be aggregated.
        Again you can select a date interval to filter out sensor readings.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_view_plot_location_data_chart">
        The pollution is shown as chart with time on the horizontal axis, and pollution value on
        the vertical axis.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_edit_plot_interpolated_data_map">
        The third plot is the interpolated data map.
        In this plot you can select which pollution data to view and a date interval.
        \n\n
        The data collected by the sensor network is used to build a prediction of what the pollution
        is in a pre-determined region.
        The prediction is computed using an interpolation method.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_view_plot_interpolated_data_map">
        This interpolation is presented a grid.
        If for each grid cell there is more than one interpolated value,
        we present the average.

    <string name="tutorial_edit_plot_line_data_chart_map">
        The last plot is the line data chart and map.
        In this plot you can also which pollution data to see, how data is aggregated, a date
        interval, the line and a distance.
        \n\n
        For each line a bus can take, we have a set of locations.
        For each location we aggregate the sensor data within the specified distance and date
        interval.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_view_plot_line_data_chart_map">
        The resulting data is presented in a map and a chart (if applicable).
        The horizontal axis in the chart data is distance from the line starting position, while the
        vertical axis contains the pollution data.
